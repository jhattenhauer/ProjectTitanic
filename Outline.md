The goal of project Titanic is to revamp the structure and nature of IcebergASV over the next year to a more formal, well distributed, sustainable team.

This includes:
- Bulletproofing the hardware system for consistent testing
- Increased training on firmware and operational software
- Development of testing tools
- Overhauling the main codebase
- Revamping online presence
- Cleaning up Github repo
