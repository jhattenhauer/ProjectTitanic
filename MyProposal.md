# Where I Come In #

## Apologies ##

I want to acknowledge that the way I left the team last August was not handled as well as it should have been.

In the month leading up to my departure, I was largely unresponsive, and after leaving I was effectively unreachable. I am sorry for that. At the time, I was not in a good headspace. Between the pressure of exams, a death in the family, and the weight of feeling like I was letting Grace and Michael down, I chose to withdraw rather than communicate.

That decision was driven by stress and self-preservation, but it came at the cost of clarity and continuity for the team. For that, I take responsibility.

IcebergASV was not on my radar in a meaningful way during that period — not because it didn’t matter to me, but because I was focused entirely on getting through what was immediately in front of me. I have since had the time and space to work on myself, regain confidence in my abilities, and reflect on what I value. One of the things I realized is that I genuinely missed working on the boat.

## Experience ##

I was recruited to IcebergASV before I even started at Memorial University and showed up to my first meeting with very little guidance on how to get involved. Like many others, I eventually carved out a niche rather than being formally onboarded.

I initially worked closely with Michael McCarthy in a hardware support role, and over time took ownership of:
- Navigation systems (Pixhawk, compass)
- Networking (WiFi bullets, telemetry radios)

Only near the end of my previous involvement did I begin moving toward software development, and even then I never fully integrated into the higher-level decision-making or machine learning portions of the stack.

Since then, I have returned with:
- More experience
- More confidence
- A clearer understanding of what went wrong structurally

I have attended two competitions and was responsible for qualifying the boat during one event when both software leads were incapacitated with food poisoning. I currently have the facilities and equipment required to test the boat, and I am confident in my ability to restructure the codebase in a way that is usable, understandable, and documented.

Most importantly, I have the persistence to **finish documentation**, not just promise it.

## Goals ##

My primary goal is to help create a **sustainable, approachable, and enjoyable project**.

Concretely, that means:
- Designing systems with efficient onboarding in mind
- Applying **KISS principles (Keep It Simple, Stupid)** wherever possible
- Cutting unnecessary libraries, frameworks, and task modules
- Prioritizing clarity over cleverness
- Treating documentation as a first-class deliverable

Beyond the technical goals, I want IcebergASV to remain what it should be:
> A group of people building a cool robot, learning together, and going to competition as friends.

## Legacy ##

IcebergASV was originally created as a short-lived project, never intended to survive beyond its founding members. I want to change that.

I want the team to leave behind:
- Strong engineering principles
- Healthy team structures
- Clear documentation
- A culture that values learning over gatekeeping

I want newer students to feel empowered instead of intimidated — to feel like they are learning robotics rather than slowing things down. That was not always my experience three years ago, and I don’t want the next generation to feel the same way.

If Project Titanic succeeds, IcebergASV won’t just build a better boat — it will build a **better team**, one that lasts.

## What I am Proposing ##

I propose that I return to the team in the capacity that I left, and to implement the changes outlined in this document. I hope you see this not as some insane power grab, but a reflection of the team without the pressure of being in the mix of it all.
